This is my Udacity React Reads project.  It is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.  It uses React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application. To use the app you can clone the repo, go to that dir and use npm install which will install all the modules needed for the app.  To run the app you can use npm start from the project main dir.
